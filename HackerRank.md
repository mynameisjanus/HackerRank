Problem 1: **Billboards**

ADZEN is a popular advertising firm in your city that owns all `n` billboard locations on Main street. The city council passed a new zoning ordinance mandating that no more than `k` consecutive billboards may be up at any given time. For example, if there are `n=3` billboards on Main street and `k=1`, ADZEN must remove either the middle billboard, the first two billboards, the last two billboards or the first and last billboard.

Being a for-profit company, ADZEN wants to lose as little advertising revenue as possible when removing the billboards. They want to comply with the new ordinance in such a way that the remaining billboards maximize their total revenues (i.e., the sum of revenues generated by the billboards left standing on Main street).

Given `n,k` and the revenue of each of the `n` billboards, find and print the maximum profit that ADZEN can earn while complying with the zoning ordinance. Assume that Main street is a straight, contiguous block of  billboards that can be removed but cannot be reordered in any way.

For example, if there are `n=7` billboards, and `k=3` is the maximum number of consecutive billboards that can be active, with `revenues=[5,6,4,2,10,8,4]`, then the maximum revenue that can be generated is `37`: `5+6+4+10+8+4=37`.
